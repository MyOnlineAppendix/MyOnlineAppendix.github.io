 * <p>
 * A callback service is a service that is used for asynchronous
 * communication from a service provider back to its client in contrast to
 * the communication through return values from synchronous operations.
 * Callbacks are used by bidirectional services, which are services that
 * have two interfaces: � an interface for the provided service � a callback
 * interface that must be provided by the client
 * <p>
 * Callbacks may be used for both remotable and local services. Either both
 * interfaces of a bidirectional service must be remotable, or both must be
 * local. It is illegal to mix the two. There are two basic forms of
 * callbacks: stateless callbacks and stateful callbacks. A callback
 * interface is declared by using the "@Callback" annotation on a remotable
 * service interface, which takes the Java Class object of the interface as
 * a parameter. The annotation may also be applied to a method or to a field
 * of an implementation, which is used in order to have a callback injected,
 * as explained in the next section.
 * <p>
 * 1.6.7.1. Stateful Callbacks A stateful callback represents a specific
 * implementation instance of the component that is the client of the
 * service. The interface of a stateful callback should be marked as
 * conversational. The following example interfaces define an interaction
 * over stateful callback.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the service in this example could use the
 * "@Callback" annotation to request that a stateful callback be injected.
 * The following is a fragment of an implementation of the example service.
 * In this example, the request is passed on to some other component, so
 * that the example service acts essentially as an intermediary. Because the
 * service is conversation scoped, the callback will still be available when
 * the backend service sends back its asynchronous response.
 * <p>
 * This fragment must come from an implementation that offers two services,
 * one that it offers to it clients (MyService) and one that is used for
 * receiving callbacks from the back end (MyServiceCallback). The client of
 * this service would also implement the methods defined in
 * MyServiceCallback.
 * <p>
 * Stateful callbacks support some of the same use cases as are supported by
 * the ability to pass service references as parameters. The primary
 * difference is that stateful callbacks do not require any additional
 * parameters be passed with service operations. This can be a great
 * convenience. If the service has many operations and any of those
 * operations could be the first operation of the conversation, it would be
 * unwieldy to have to take a callback parameter as part of every operation,
 * just in case it is the first operation of the conversation. It is also
 * more natural than requiring the application developers to invoke an
 * explicit operation whose only purpose is to pass the callback object that
 * should be used.
 * <p>
 * This tests the *local* bidirectional interfaces option
